# awesome-branch-name

> Easily generate warm, crunchy branch names. Perfect for people who enjoy a cheesy,
> flakey branch, but don't always have the energy to come up with a good name.

## Install

Install globally to generate delicious branch names with maximum efficiency.

```console
$ npm install -g awesome-branch-name
$ awesome-branch-name
```

## Usage

Print an awesome branch name.

```console
$ awesome-branch-name
```

Or, run using npx.

```console
$ npx awesome-branch-name
```

Immediately checkout a new, flavorful branch.

```console
$ git checkout -b `awesome-branch-name`
```

Provide the optional `keyword` argument to include the designated word somewhere
in the generated name.

```console
$ awesome-branch-name MyNewFeature
```

Save it in your `.bashrc` and use it everyday.

```sh
branch() {
  git checkout -b "dev/`awesome-branch-name $1`"
}
```

Or if you prefer `npx`, make sure to specify `-q` to silence npx output.

```sh
branch() {
  git checkout -b "dev/`npx -q awesome-branch-name $1`"
}
```

## How are these names generated?

Branch names are generated by taking cards from the [MtG JSON Card Database](https://mtgjson.com/),
massaging them, and then assigning scores based on a simple algorithm designed to
weed out cards that would make unpleasant branch names.
